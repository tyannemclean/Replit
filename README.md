Will Chatbot be helpful or end up making you want to talk to a human? 
Chatbot will require you to answer using the options you do not want right now. 
I think chatbot works at a retail store.
Please press 1 for help with sizing. 
Press 2 for a refund
Press 3 in order to talk to a sales associate. 
Please press 4 to hang up. 

And then if they pick a number then theres 1a, 1b, 1c ect.
